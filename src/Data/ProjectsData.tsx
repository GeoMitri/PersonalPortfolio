Upon beginning the first level the player encounters a friendly frog named Ribbit. Ribbit hands the player a weapon called the GridBlade, which has the power to slash lines in the air to strike enemies. Ribbit explains that the GridBlade requires commands to work, in the form of linear equations.",

The intention was to create an accessible game anyone could play, while rewarding mastery with greater challenges and rewards. Stepping Stones is my first commercialised solo project, available now on both Google Play and iOS App Store",
