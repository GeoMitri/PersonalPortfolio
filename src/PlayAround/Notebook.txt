      {xs: sm: md: lg: xl:}

      
      [theme.breakpoints.up('md')]: {
        backgroundColor: 'red',
      },
  
  <CssBaseline>
    https://mui.com/material-ui/react-css-baseline/
    removes margins & other MUI default styles

  <Typography>
    https://mui.com/material-ui/api/typography/
    I don't know why gutterBottom also stops text overflow 
      Nevermind its not

  <Grid>
    "justifyContent" and "alignItems" 
      refer to the object's "direction" prop
      need "container" prop (not "item")
    Consider "columnGap" / "rowGap" props for content spacing
    Positioning elements freely
      container
        sx={{position: 'relative'}}
      element
        sx={{position: 'absolute', width: ..., top: ..., ...}}

  <ToggleButtonGroup>
    Doesn't like custom data types for value prop
      Causes no colour to light up
      Work around by using string as an index and performing other instructions in the onChange{} function.

  href
    external links need "https:// ..."

  props
    Passing whole object with interface x a prop
      <Component {...object}/>

  Struturing Data folder
    can export all consts separately OR
    Make 1 const list of all values of types of value
    
  Function Compoment props
    Parameters of Function Components are typically 1
      This is what is expected if the FC is being instantiated elsewhere
      Otherwise you get 1 level down of missing props
    ALWAYS instantiate FCs like <This /> and not This()
      Avoids "Rendered fewer hooks than expected" error
