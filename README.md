## Here is my React Website Potfolio!

#### Built using React 5 using TypeScript and Material UI.

#### Released live at www.georgemitri.com

#### Project Structure:
##### Components
	Diplayable items, categorised into a folder per page template
		Each folder contains:
				1 page component 
					named after the folder
					hosts other components in the folder
					should have close-to nothing but components
				0-M content components
					name begins with the page name
					used for the page into the page 
##### Data
	written static info that is used by components
		.ts
		return val is always ALLCAPS
##### Objects
	class-like structures (typically interfaces) used by Data or Components
##### Utils
	useful code snippets that help me build components
##### Playaround
	notes for myself
